# Getting Started

GridSheet provides Excel-like spreadsheet functionality across multiple frameworks and vanilla JavaScript. Choose the implementation that best fits your project:

## Framework Support

| Framework | Features | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **[React](/getting-started/react)** | Full-featured with hooks, TypeScript, comprehensive events | React apps, TypeScript projects, complex state |
| **[Vue](/getting-started/vue)** | Composition API, Options API, Vue 3 support | Vue applications, progressive enhancement |
| **[Svelte](/getting-started/svelte)** | Lightweight with stores, optimized performance | Svelte apps, performance-critical projects |
| **[Vanilla JS](/getting-started/vanilla)** | Framework-agnostic, minimal bundle size | Vanilla JS, legacy apps, minimal dependencies |

**Note:** React and Vanilla JS versions support all GridSheet features. Vue and Svelte versions have some limitations due to being wrapped implementations.
