## Implementation Guide

### 🎨 Pixel Art Drawing Interface Overview
This comprehensive pixel art drawing interface demonstrates how GridSheet can be used to create creative applications beyond traditional spreadsheet use cases. The implementation includes color selection, drawing tools, data persistence, and artistic features.

### 📐 Grid-Based Drawing System
Implement a grid-based drawing system that treats each cell as a pixel. Create a canvas-like interface with customizable grid sizes and cell dimensions. Support both individual cell coloring and area filling operations.

### 🎨 Color Palette Management
Create a comprehensive color palette system with predefined colors and custom color selection. Implement color preview, selection indicators, and color history. Include accessibility features for color-blind users.

### 🖌️ Drawing Tools and Operations
Implement various drawing tools including single cell coloring, area filling, and selection-based operations. Support keyboard shortcuts, mouse interactions, and touch gestures. Include undo/redo functionality for drawing operations.

### 💾 Data Persistence and Export
Implement data persistence using localStorage to save drawing progress automatically. Create export functionality for saving drawings as images or data files. Include import capabilities for loading existing drawings.

### 📦 Selection and Area Operations
Create selection tools that allow users to select multiple cells for bulk operations. Implement area filling, copying, and moving operations. Include visual feedback for selection areas and operation previews.

### 🎨 User Interface Design
Design an intuitive drawing interface with clear tool organization and visual feedback. Include color palette, drawing tools, and canvas area. Implement responsive design that works across different screen sizes.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization
Optimize drawing performance for large grids and complex operations. Implement efficient rendering, memory management, and update mechanisms. Consider virtualization for very large drawing canvases.

### 🎨 Drawing Patterns and Templates
Provide predefined drawing patterns and templates for common pixel art subjects. Include geometric shapes, simple objects, and artistic patterns. Allow users to save and share custom templates.
