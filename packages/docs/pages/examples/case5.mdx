## Implementation Guide

### 📋 Menu Bar Implementation
Create a professional menu bar with dropdown menus for common spreadsheet operations. Implement File operations (Save/Reset), Edit operations (Undo/Redo/Cut/Copy/Paste), and Format operations (Background/Text Color). Include proper event handling and user feedback.

### 📑 Multiple Sheet Management
Implement a multi-sheet interface with tabbed navigation at the bottom. Each sheet maintains its own data and state while sharing common functionality. Include sheet switching, data isolation, and proper state management for each sheet.

### 💾 Data Persistence with localStorage
Implement data persistence using browser localStorage for automatic data saving. Save sheet data, active sheet selection, and user preferences. Include error handling for storage limitations and data corruption scenarios.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts and Auto-Save
Implement keyboard shortcuts for common operations including Ctrl+S for saving data. The onSave callback is automatically triggered when users press Ctrl+S, providing familiar Excel-like behavior. Include visual feedback and notifications for save operations.

### 🎨 Color Formatting System
Create a comprehensive color formatting system with background and text color options. Implement color picker dialogs, color preview, and undo/redo functionality for formatting changes. Include accessibility considerations for color-blind users.

### 🎯 Professional UI Design
Design a professional interface that mimics Excel's familiar layout and styling. Include proper spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy. Implement responsive design that works across different screen sizes and devices.

### 📋 Clipboard Operations
Implement full clipboard functionality including cut, copy, and paste operations. Handle cell ranges, multiple data types, and cross-sheet operations. Include proper error handling and user feedback for clipboard operations.

### ↩️ Undo/Redo System
Create a robust undo/redo system that tracks all user actions including data changes, formatting, and structural modifications. Implement efficient state management and memory optimization for large datasets.

### 📊 Sheet Data Management
Manage different types of sheet data including sales data, budget information, and inventory tracking. Implement appropriate formulas, formatting, and validation for each data type. Include sample data and realistic business scenarios.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization
Optimize performance for large datasets and multiple sheets. Implement efficient rendering, memory management, and state updates. Consider virtualization and lazy loading for better performance.
