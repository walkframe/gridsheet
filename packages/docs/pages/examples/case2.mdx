### 🌐 GitHub API Integration
This demo demonstrates how to integrate external APIs with GridSheet for real-time data display. The implementation uses the GitHub API to fetch contributor data from the React repository, showcasing how to handle asynchronous data loading and API responses.

### 📡 Data Fetching Strategy
Implement efficient data fetching using React hooks and async/await patterns. The strategy includes loading states, error handling, and data transformation. Use proper state management to handle the asynchronous nature of API calls.

### 🔄 Data Transformation
Transform API response data into the matrix format required by GridSheet. Use utility functions to convert object arrays to matrix format, ensuring proper field mapping and data structure compatibility.

### 🖼️ Custom Image Renderer
Create custom renderers for displaying user avatars as circular background images. These renderers handle image URLs, apply styling for circular avatars, and include visual effects like borders and shadows for professional appearance.

### 🔗 Interactive Link Renderer
Implement interactive link renderers that display URLs as clickable elements. Include hover effects, visual feedback, and proper styling to enhance user experience. Handle cases where URLs might be missing or invalid.

### 🔢 Number Formatting
Apply custom number formatting for contribution counts using thousand separators. This improves readability of large numbers and provides consistent formatting across the application.

### ⏳ Loading State Management
Implement comprehensive loading states with visual indicators like spinners. Provide user feedback during data fetching operations and handle loading states gracefully to prevent layout shifts.

### ⚠️ Error Handling
Include robust error handling for API failures, network issues, and data processing errors. Provide meaningful error messages and fallback states to ensure application reliability.

### 📱 Responsive Design
Design the interface to work across different screen sizes and devices. Use responsive layouts, flexible grids, and adaptive styling to ensure optimal user experience on various platforms.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization
Optimize performance for large datasets by implementing efficient rendering strategies. Consider virtualization for large contributor lists and optimize image loading for better performance.

### ✅ Best Practices
1. **API Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement proper caching
2. **Error Boundaries**: Use React error boundaries for graceful error handling
3. **Loading States**: Provide clear loading indicators for better UX
4. **Data Validation**: Validate API responses before processing
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible
6. **Performance**: Optimize image loading and rendering performance
7. **Security**: Handle external URLs safely and prevent XSS attacks
