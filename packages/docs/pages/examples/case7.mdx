### 🔄 Real-time Collaboration Overview
This comprehensive real-time collaboration interface demonstrates how GridSheet can be used to create collaborative spreadsheet applications. The implementation includes user presence tracking, real-time updates, activity logging, and conflict resolution mechanisms.

### 👤 User Presence Management
Implement user presence tracking with visual indicators including colored cursors, avatars, and status indicators. Track user activity, cursor positions, and online status. Provide real-time updates of user presence across all connected clients.

### ⚡ Real-time Data Synchronization
Create real-time data synchronization that propagates changes across all connected users. Implement efficient update mechanisms, conflict resolution, and data consistency. Handle network latency and connection issues gracefully.

### 📝 Activity Logging System
Develop a comprehensive activity logging system that tracks all user actions including edits, cursor movements, and formatting changes. Display activity feed with timestamps, user attribution, and action descriptions. Implement activity filtering and search capabilities.

### 🎨 Visual User Attribution
Implement visual user attribution for all changes including color-coded highlights, user avatars, and change indicators. Provide clear visual feedback for which user made specific changes. Include temporary highlighting for recent edits.

### 📋 Policy-Based Formatting
Use policies to maintain consistent formatting across collaborative editing sessions. Implement automatic formatting rules, style inheritance, and conflict resolution for formatting changes. Ensure data integrity while allowing collaborative styling.

### ⚔️ Conflict Resolution
Implement robust conflict resolution mechanisms for simultaneous edits. Handle edit conflicts, data merging, and version control. Provide user feedback for conflicts and resolution options.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization
Optimize performance for real-time collaboration with multiple users. Implement efficient update batching, change compression, and selective synchronization. Consider bandwidth limitations and connection quality.

### 🎨 User Interface Design
Design collaborative interfaces that clearly show user presence and activity. Include user lists, activity feeds, and collaboration controls. Implement intuitive visual indicators for different types of user activity.

### 🌐 Network Communication
Implement efficient network communication for real-time updates. Use WebSocket connections, message queuing, and connection management. Handle reconnection scenarios and offline editing capabilities.

### ✅ Best Practices
1. **Data Consistency**: Ensure data consistency across all connected users
2. **User Experience**: Provide clear visual feedback for all collaborative actions
3. **Performance**: Optimize for real-time updates and multiple concurrent users
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Implement robust conflict resolution mechanisms
5. **Network Resilience**: Handle network issues and connection problems gracefully
6. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization for collaborative features
7. **Scalability**: Design for multiple concurrent users and large datasets

### 🎯 Common Use Cases
- **Team Collaboration**: Real-time team spreadsheet editing
- **Project Management**: Collaborative project tracking and planning
- **Financial Modeling**: Multi-user financial analysis and modeling
- **Data Entry**: Collaborative data entry and validation
- **Documentation**: Real-time collaborative documentation creation

### 🚀 Advanced Features
