# Case 9: Security & Data Protection

This example demonstrates advanced security features in GridSheet, including data masking, clipboard protection, and custom security functions for password management.

<Case9 />

## Features

- **Data Masking**: Password column is partially masked in display (first 2 characters visible, rest as asterisks)
- **Clipboard Protection**: Copying sensitive data results in masked values in clipboard
- **Custom Security Functions**: Built-in security functions for data hashing and encryption
- **Selective Protection**: Only the Password column is protected while others remain fully accessible
- **Formula Bar Hidden**: Formula bar is disabled to prevent password exposure

## How it works

The security system uses a combination of policies and renderers to protect sensitive data:

1. **Security Policy**: Intercepts clipboard operations and replaces sensitive data with asterisks
2. **Security Renderer**: Displays partially masked values in the grid interface
3. **Custom Functions**: Security functions for data hashing and processing
4. **Selective Application**: Security features are applied only to the Password column

## Security Functions

- `SECURE_HASH(text)`: Creates a secure hash of the input text for password storage

## Implementation

The security features are implemented using:
- Custom policies with `onClip` handlers for clipboard protection
- Custom renderers with `string` methods for display masking
- Custom functions extending `BaseFunction` for security operations
- Hub configuration to register all security components

This approach ensures that sensitive data remains protected both during display and when copied to external applications.

## Try it out

1. **Data Masking**: Notice how the Password column shows only the first 2 characters, with the rest masked as asterisks
2. **Clipboard Protection**: Try copying cells from the Password column - you'll get asterisks in your clipboard
3. **Custom Functions**: The Hash column uses the SECURE_HASH function to generate secure hashes of passwords
4. **Visual Indicators**: Different colored borders and backgrounds indicate security levels

## Security Features Explained

- **Data Masking**: Password column shows only first 2 characters, rest are masked with asterisks
- **Clipboard Protection**: Copying sensitive cells results in asterisks in clipboard
- **Custom Functions**: SECURE_HASH creates hexadecimal hashes for secure password storage
- **Selective Protection**: Only the Password column is protected, others remain fully accessible
- **Formula Bar Hidden**: Formula bar is disabled to prevent password exposure in the formula bar
