### 📊 Data Visualization Overview
This comprehensive dashboard demonstrates how GridSheet can be used for business intelligence applications. It combines data visualization, formula-based calculations, and dynamic styling to create an interactive business analytics tool.

### 📊 Custom Chart Renderers
Implement custom renderers for data visualization using Chart.js integration. These renderers convert numerical data into visual representations including bar charts, line graphs, and progress indicators. The renderers automatically update when underlying data changes.

### 📊 Bar Chart Implementation
Create progress bar visualizations for numerical data using HTML5 progress elements. These bars show relative performance with color-coded indicators based on value thresholds. The implementation includes responsive sizing and dynamic color changes based on performance levels.

### 🈈 Line Chart with Chart.js
Integrate Chart.js for sophisticated line chart visualizations. These charts display time-series data with smooth animations, interactive tooltips, and professional styling. The implementation handles data extraction from GridSheet tables and converts them to Chart.js format.

### 🔢 Formula-Based Calculations
Implement dynamic calculations using spreadsheet formulas. These include SUM functions for totals, AVERAGE functions for trends, and custom functions for specialized calculations. Formulas automatically recalculate when source data changes, ensuring real-time accuracy.

### 🔍 MATCH and INDEX Functions
Use MATCH function to find the position of values within ranges. This enables dynamic lookups and conditional logic based on data positions. Combine with INDEX function to retrieve values from specific positions, creating powerful data analysis capabilities.

### 📈 Trend Analysis
Implement trend analysis using conditional formulas. Compare quarterly performance to identify growth patterns and trends. Use IF statements to categorize performance levels and provide actionable insights based on data comparisons.

### 🎨 Dynamic Styling
Apply conditional styling based on data values and performance indicators. Use color coding to highlight trends, performance levels, and important metrics. This creates visual hierarchy and makes data interpretation intuitive.

### ⚙️ Custom Functions
Create custom functions for specialized calculations like moving averages. These functions extend GridSheet's formula capabilities and can integrate with external data sources or complex business logic.

### 🔗 Data Integration
Handle various data types including numbers, text, dates, and complex objects. Implement proper data validation and error handling to ensure robust data processing. Support for different data formats enables flexible data integration.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization
Optimize rendering performance for large datasets and complex visualizations. Use efficient data structures, minimize re-renders, and implement proper memory management. Consider virtualization for large datasets.
