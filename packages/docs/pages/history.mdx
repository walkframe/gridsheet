const validation = {
  type: 'number',
  min: 0,
  max: 100
};
```

**After (2.x):**
```tsx
// New policy approach
const BudgetPolicy = {
  validate: (props) => {
    const { patch } = props;
    const value = Number(patch.value);
    if (isNaN(value) || value < 0) {
      return { ...patch, value: 0 };
    }
    if (value > 100) {
      return { ...patch, value: 100 };
    }
    return patch;
  }
};
```
